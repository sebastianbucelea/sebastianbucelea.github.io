Our team, which is composed by four EPITA students, has got as a main objective
the proper presentation of a 3D-game developed in the C# programming language
with Unity. The main reason why we have chosen to develop a video game as our
project was the common interest that we share regarding this domain, as well as the
variety of challenges, which go from coding, to artistic design and physics analysis
that a project of this kind presents. Therefore, as far as we are concerned, we see
game development as one of the most skill-requiring theme for such a task, as well as
a branch of Computer Science suited for enhancing personal knowledge that has an
unlimited future ahead of it.

<p align = "center">As for the main subject of the game, we have chosen it to be a level-based mixture
between a platform and a puzzle type of game, animated by a captivating storyline.
Our main sources of inspiration have been the game Little Nightmares, popular for its
complex storyline that made it a commercial success, as well as last year’s projects.
Therefore, the story of our game is the story of a sphere, which justifies the title of
the project, ”Kivos”, a term meaning a geometrical structure in Greek. The main
plot is escaping an island by solving various tasks and mysteries, which consist of
challenges and puzzles. Plot twists and surprising events are there to amplify the joy
of playing the game. A multiplayer mod is going to be implemented in order to make
interacting between different players possible and to enhance the entertainment that
the main idea provides by making experience sharing possible
